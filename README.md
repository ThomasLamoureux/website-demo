# Cyber Security Website Demo
### This is a simple website created for a presentation for my Intro to Cybersecurity class at Stetson University. The website has security issues intentionally implemented to demonstrate the important of properly handling info communicated between the server and client.

Please note that this repo was forked from my alt account.
